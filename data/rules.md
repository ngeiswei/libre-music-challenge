## General

- The challenge starts on the 1st of each month and runs for the entire length of the month.
- All submissions must be made with free (libre) software only. This includes the DAW and all plugins. A non-free operating system is allowed.
- Submissions must be original work produced specifically for this contest. No covers, remakes, or remixes of existing work.
- There is no track length limit.
- Collaborations are allowed.
- We might request project files to ensure that the track complies with the rules. Failure to provide this will result in disqualification.
- Regardless of any challenge-specific restriction on plugins, basic utility plugins are always allowed, unless specified otherwise. These include things like Limiters, EQ and Filtering, Volume and Pan, and MIDI manipulation.

## Submission

- You must submit your entry before the end of the month.
- When submitting an entry you agree that your song will be made available under the CC-BY-SA license.
  You can publish your song under a different license if you like, but CC-BY-SA is the license that we will apply to your song once it's in the archive of the challenge.
- You must announce your submission in this forum thread, providing a link to your song.
  You must also include a short description of how it was made. Specifically, list all of the software and plugins that you have used.
- You can upload your track anywhere you like. However, you must provide access to the audio file to your song. This is so that we can store the tracks into our archive.
- You must provide your audio file in a libre file format. Generally either FLAC or Ogg Vorbis.
  The file name must follow the following convention: "Artist Name - Song Name". You can use any capitalization you like.
  A WAV file is allowed, but it will be encoded as FLAC for the archive upload.
- Publishing your project files is not mandatory but encouraged, in the spirit of learning and sharing knowledge with each other.
- You can keep working on your submitted track until the challenge is over. Only the final version will be considered for voting.

## Voting

- Voting runs from the 1st to the 15th of the month following the end of the challenge. Failure to vote in time will result in disqualification.
- Voting is done by giving all submissions a score from 1 to 5 (where 5 is best). You don't vote on your own submission.
- All participants are required to vote on ALL of the other tracks. Not doing so will result in disqualification.
- Participants of previous challenges are also welcome to vote, even if they haven't made a submission.
- The submission with the most points is the winner.
- There is no prize other than eternal glory.
- All submissions will be stored on archive.org and freely available under a CC-BY-SA license.
